5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
It will copy all the files starting with 'temp-' at once to the current directory from the directory that is one level above.

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
Git init creates a new repository and we only need to create a repository once in each project.
Therefore, this greends-fads-first-project repository was already initiated. 
So there is no need of running git init.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
A way of committing the files is by doing 'git add .', which is going to add all files at once, and running 'git commit * -m 'second commit'
